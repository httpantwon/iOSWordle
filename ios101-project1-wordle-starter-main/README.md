# Project 1 - Wordle

Submitted by: Antwon Walls

Wordle is an app mimicking the popular New York Times web-game Wordle.
It involves figuring out a secret five-letter word. The user plays by
guessing different combinations of letters to make up a new word to 
see how close they are to the secret word. When the user submits a guess, 
the game will tell them how close their guess is by color-coding each 
letter with either gray, yellow, or green.

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Notes

The challenges I faced all centered around not being familiar with the Swift language after being so used to C++. Swift is not your typical coding language so the syntax can be funny looking for first-time learners. It felt very complex. The smallest things that I didn't think would cause errors did (e.g. not using dot notation: .initial vs. initial from a class definition; the importance of the self keyword; what an enum is; calling functions in a controller that were defined in a controller; learning how to do a switch statement in Swift)
